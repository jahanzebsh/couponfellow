<h2>YOUR SECURITY</h2>

<p>We use a variety of methods, such as cookies and pixel tags to collect this information, which may include your (a) IP-address; (b) unique cookie identifier, cookie information and information on whether your device has software to access certain features; (c) unique device identifier and device type; (d) domain, browser type and language; (e) operating system and system settings; (f) country and time zone; (g) previously visited websites; (h) information about your interaction with our Sites such as click behavior, purchases and indicated preferences; and (i) access times and referring URLs.</p>
<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not wish to have cookies on your system, you can set your browser to refuse them. Please review the specific instructions from your browser in order to do this. However, please note that not accepting cookies may make certain features of our Sites unavailable or difficult to view or use.</p>
<p>In some of our email messages we may use a “click-through URL” linked to content on our Sites. When you click one of these URLs, you will pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our Sites. If you prefer not to be tracked through our emails, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.</p>
<p>Approved third parties may also collect information on our Sites through the usage of cookies, third party plug-ins and widgets in order to deliver targeted advertisements to you across the Internet, commonly known as Behavioral retargeting.</p>
<p>Our web server may collect clickstream information such as the address (or URL) of the website that you came from before visiting the Sites, which pages you visit on the Sites, which browser you used to view the Sites, and any search terms you may have entered on our site, among other things. The Sites may also use other technologies to track which pages our visitors view.</p>
<h2>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>Most commonly we will use your Personal Information in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you have asked us to do so, or consented to us doing so;</li>
<li>Where we need to do so in order to perform a contract we have entered into with you;</li>
<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your fundamental rights do not override those interests; and</li>
<li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2>
<p>We are committed to maintaining your trust, and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share Personal Information and information collected about you. We do not share your Personal Information with any third parties except as set forth herein.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to outside individuals and/or companies that help us bring you the products and services we offer and to create, operate, and maintain our Sites. For example, we may work with third parties to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist us in distributing emails; (c) assist us with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide data storage and analysis; (e) provide fraud prevention; (f) provide customer service; and (g) provide other services designed to assist us in developing and running our Sites and maximizing our business potential. We require that these outside companies agree to keep all information shared with them confidential and to use the information only to perform their obligations to us.</p>
<p>If we seek investors or go through a business transition, including but not limited to, a merger, acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be shared as part of the negotiation of the transaction and will likely be among the assets transferred in the event of a sale or partial sale of our assets.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Website, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of Users of the Sites or the public.</p>
<h2>TARGETED ADVERTISING AND REMARKETING</h2>
<p>You may see advertisements for our services on other websites and mobile applications because we work with third party advertisers to engage in remarketing and retargeting activities. Through our relationships with these advertisers, we can target messaging to our users by interest-based, demographic, contextual, and other means. These third party advertisers track your online activities over time and across websites and mobile applications by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of third-party cookies, web server logs, and web beacons. They use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our advertising partners may collect includes data about your visits to websites and mobile applications that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites and mobile applications that participate in the advertising networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Some third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA” - <a href="https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/">https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/</a>) or Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI” - <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>). We comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising set forth by the DAA. You have the ability to opt-out of targeting through both the DAA and NAI, as described below.</p>
<h2>LINKS TO AND FROM OTHER WEBSITES</h2>
<p>Our Sites may contain links or references to websites operated by third parties, or you may have come to our Sites using a link found on another website. This does not mean that we endorse these websites or the goods or services they provide. We do not make any representations or warranties about any website that may be linked to the Site. Such other websites are independent from us, and we have no control over, or responsibility for, their information, products or activities. Our privacy practices may differ from those of these other websites. If you provide Personal Information at one of these third party websites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that website, not our Privacy Policy. Please make sure you understand the other website's privacy policy before providing such website with any Personal Information.</p>

<h2>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION AND OPTING OUT</h2>
<p>There are ways by which you can control how your Personal Information is used.</p>
<h3>Tracking Cookies</h3>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse some or all cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please visit your specific browser’s instructions for doing this. The “Help” function on most browsers contains information on how you can set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies, or you can disable them entirely. If you opt out of cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of various features of the Sites that are available to other users. For example, we may use cookies to remember if you’ve already used or voted on certain coupons. If you use more than one browser, you will need to change each browser’s settings in order to refuse cookies.</p>
<h3>Promotional Offers</h3>
<p>If you do not wish to receive our email promotional offers, you may opt-out by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link found in emails we send to you. Please allow up to ten (10) business days for changes to your email preferences to take effect. During that time, you may continue to receive email communications from us that were already in process.</p>
<h3>Behavioral Advertising</h3>
<p>If you do not want us to use information that we collect for us to deliver behavioral advertisements to you, you can opt-out of receiving such advertising.</p>
<p>You may opt out of online behavioral advertising on your device by visiting the DAA’s consumer choice page, currently available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>, or the NAI’s opt out tool currently available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>.</p>

We do not make any representations or warranties about such opt-out services. Such services are independent from us, and we have no control over, or responsibility for their performance.</p>

<p>Our products and services use Google Analytics and its associated tracking technologies to help display our ads you see on other sites, and to help us manage and optimize our online advertising efforts.
