<p>These Terms of Use ("Terms of use") are set forth by NextGen Shopping, LLC, a System 1, Inc. company ("couponfellow" or "us" or "we"). These Terms of Use and our <a href="https://couponfellow.com/docs/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, incorporated herein by reference, govern your use of our online services, any content or information therein, the couponfellow.com website, any subdomains of couponfellow.com, and/or any of our mobile applications, websites, or browser extensions on which services are provided by us (collectively, the "Site").</p>
<p>By accessing this Site, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms Use, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these Terms of Use, you are prohibited from using or accessing this Site. The materials contained in this Site are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p><strong>These Terms of Use are subject to an arbitration provision and include a waiver of the right to bring an action in court. Please see the Dispute Resolution section below for more details.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>If you are having any trouble accessing these Terms of Use or the Site, please contact us at (631) 772-9540‬. Our hours of operations are: Monday – Friday 9am-5pm et. We use third party tools and services to review and monitor the accessibility of the Site, and are regularly seeking to improve its performance.</p>
<h2>Use of the Site</h2>
<p>Use of this Site is solely for your personal and non-commercial use. Except as may be explicitly permitted through this Site, you agree not to save, download, cut and paste, sell, license, rent, lease, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit, catalogue, aggregate, or create derivative works from materials, code or content on or from this Site. Systematic retrieval of data or other content from this Site to create or compile, directly or indirectly, a collection, compilation, database or directory without written permission from couponfellow is prohibited. Exceeding your permitted access or trying to automate what are otherwise manual interactions with the Site are expressly prohibited. In addition, use of the content or materials for any purpose not expressly permitted in these Terms of Use is prohibited.</p>
<h2>couponfellow Rewards Program</h2>
<p>You may earn rewards through the couponfellow Rewards Program (the “Program”) by making certain qualifying purchases and through other promotions and offers that may be provided by us. See our <a href="https://support.couponfellow.com/">Help Center</a> for more information on the Program.</p>
<p>As part of the Program, you may also choose to download and install the Cently by couponfellow browser extension. We hereby grant you a non-exclusive, limited, right and license to download and install the browser extension for your own personal use. You must ensure that you have the right to install the browser extension on the device where it is used. We may automatically, and without prior notice, update or modify the browser extension.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no cost to join the Program.</li>
<li>Only residents of the United States who are over eighteen (18) years of age are eligible to become Program members (“Members”). Members must have a registered couponfellow account (“Account”) and a valid PayPal account registered with a United States address in order to obtain rewards. The Program is void where prohibited by law, and is subject to change as may be necessary to comply with such laws or regulations. couponfellow may change these eligibility requirements at any time, and reserves the right to refuse membership and/or participation to any applicant for any reason, in its sole discretion.</li>
<li>Rewards may be earned as “cashback” (“Cashback Rewards” or “Rewards”) on eligible purchases made with select merchant websites (“Merchants”). To be eligible to receive Cashback Rewards: (i) sign into your couponfellow account; (ii) ensure cookies are enabled on your browser; and (iii) make a qualifying purchase (“Qualifying Purchase”) with a select Merchant, by either clicking on a qualifying cashback link through the desktop browser with the couponfellow extension installed or by clicking on a qualifying cashback link on our Site.</li>
<li>Clicking on other coupon or “cashback” websites, browser extensions, or websites with affiliate links after making a Qualifying Purchase may invalidate couponfellow’s tracking, and therefore that purchase may cease to be a Qualifying Purchase.</li>
<li>You will not receive Cashback Rewards for: items excluded by law; shipping; the value of any merchant discounts or coupons; gift-wrapping; gift cards, unless specifically stated; credits; extended warranties; taxes (in most cases); nor any items that couponfellow or the particular Merchant deems ineligible. A purchase may cease to be a Qualifying Purchase and the associated Cashback Rewards may be invalidated if the purchase is returned, exchanged, or cancelled by the Merchant. Cashback Rewards are only recorded if the Reward value exceeds $0.01.</li>
<li>couponfellow will attempt to credit Member Accounts with the corresponding Cashback Rewards on a timely basis. Members, however, have the responsibility of ensuring that their Cashback Rewards are properly credited. Any claim for Cashback Rewards not accurately credited must be received by us within 90 calendar days of the relevant Qualifying Purchase. A claim for missing Cashback Rewards can be made online using the form located at:&nbsp;<a href="https://rewards.couponfellow.com/track-cashback">https://rewards.couponfellow.com/track-cashback</a>.</li>
<li>On occasion, merchants may adjust the commission rate that they pay, which will either increase or decrease the cashback rate that we are able to pass on to Members. In situations like this, it can mean that the rate that we advertise on our site may be incorrect. While we take reasonable care to ensure that the rates that we advertise are up to date we give no warranty of the accuracy of any information on the site and do not accept liability for any errors or omissions, nor do we accept liability for any resulting damage or loss.</li>
<li>At our sole discretion, we may deduct cashback from your account in order to adjust for returns and cancellations with respect to purchases you have made as part of the Rewards program. Any such adjustments will be made in accordance with this Agreement, any applicable Company policies and terms, the terms of the Affiliate Store offer and any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.</li>
<li>Members must connect their own personal PayPal account to their couponfellow Account, and the PayPal account must be registered with a United States address. A single PayPal account cannot be connected to multiple Program Accounts, and each user is only permitted to have one account with couponfellow. Payment of Rewards will be processed monthly to the Member’s PayPal account. The minimum payment for Rewards is $10. For clarity, payment of Member Rewards will only be processed when the accrued balance reaches $10.</li>
<li>In addition to, and independent of the Program, Merchants may have their own terms and conditions, which describe specifically how couponfellow works with respect to purchases from that specific Merchant. Such third-party terms and conditions may describe things such as how you earn Rewards, which items are excluded from earning Rewards. In certain cases, the Merchant may also provide you with additional benefits that are not directly related to couponfellow (e.g., price discounts on certain items). couponfellow bears no liability under or responsibility for any Merchant-provided terms and conditions, or for any associated additional benefits, which are offered solely by the applicable Merchant, and may be changed or discontinued at the sole and exclusive discretion of such Merchant.</li>
<li>Legacy referral programs which were entered into by you prior to May 09, 2022 will continue to be honored, but no new referral programs will be offered after this date.</li>
<li>From time to time, couponfellow and the Merchants may provide you with additional ways to earn Rewards through offers, promotions, and other programs. Such offers and promotions may be subject to additional terms and conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Account Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may use the Site without registration, but in order to take advantage of many aspects of the Site, you will need to become a registered user using your email address. Your account is for your sole, personal use, you may not authorize others to use your account, and you may not assign or otherwise transfer your account to any other person or entity. You are responsible for the security of your account and will be solely liable for any use or unauthorized use under such password.</li>
<li>We may suspend or terminate your access or the Program, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice. We may suspend or terminate Rewards for any violation of these Terms of Use.</li>
<li>You hereby grant couponfellow and its Merchants the right to monitor your couponfellow Account activity. We have the right to take any necessary legal action based on fraud, abuse, or suspicious activity in connection with your couponfellow Account or any of your activities relating to couponfellow, and you agree to cooperate with any such action or investigation. If you are engaged in such activity, you may be liable for monetary losses, including litigation and/or arbitration costs and damages. This section shall survive the termination of couponfellow, the Program, or your Account.</li>
<li>You may cancel your account at any time by choosing ‘Delete Account’ from the Account Settings tab located at&nbsp;<a href="https://rewards.couponfellow.com/settings">https://rewards.couponfellow.com/settings</a> when logged into their membership portal. If you cancel your account, any unredeemed Rewards will immediately be voided.</li>
<li>All accrued Rewards shall expire if no Qualifying Purchase is made through a Member’s Account for a consecutive period of one (1) year from the date of Member’s last Qualifying Purchase. couponfellow reserves the right to extend the expiration date, at its own discretion, on an individual Member basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Member wishes to maintain their Account without making a Qualifying Purchase, Members can extend their expiration date by twelve (12) months by sending an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:help@couponfellow.com">help@couponfellow.com</a>&nbsp;from Member’s registered email address with the subject line “Please Maintain My couponfellow Account.”</li>

The parties shall then make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution. In the event that the dispute is not resolved through this procedure, the party raising the dispute may proceed to mandatory arbitration as set forth below.</p>
<h3>Arbitration</h3>
<p>ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under these Terms of Use, except for matters that fall within the jurisdiction of your local small claims court, which may be pursued in that court. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, NOT a judge or jury. You agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, including with respect to the interpretation of any provision of these Terms of Use or other agreements between you and us, or concerning the performance or obligations of you and/or us, shall be resolved by mandatory and binding arbitration submitted to JAMS in accordance with its rules and Consumer Arbitration Standards at the request of either us or you pursuant to the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place of Arbitration Hearings. Unless you elect to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submission, an in-person arbitration hearing will be conducted at a JAMS facility in your area or at a JAMS facility in New York, New York.</li>
<li>Selection of Arbitrator shall be made pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures or JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures, depending on the amount of the claim as specified herein.</li>
<li>Conduct of Arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator under JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures. For claims exceeding $5,000.00, the arbitration shall be conducted under JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures Subject to the applicable JAMS procedure, the arbitrator shall allow reasonable discovery in the forms permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent consistent with the purpose of the arbitration. The arbitrator(s) shall have no power or authority to amend or disregard any provision of this section or any other provision of these Terms of Use, except as necessary to comply with JAMS’ Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness. The arbitration hearing shall be commenced promptly and conducted expeditiously. If more than one day is necessary, the arbitration hearing shall be conducted on consecutive days unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties.</li>
<li>Findings and Conclusions. The arbitrator(s) shall, after reaching judgment and award, prepare and distribute to the parties written findings of fact and conclusions of law relevant to such judgment and award and containing an opinion setting forth the reasons for the giving or denial of any award. The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Costs and Fees. You will be subject to a filing fee, set by JAMS, to initiate the arbitration. To the extent permitted by JAMS procedures, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the arbitrators’ and administrative fees of arbitration, and we will remain responsible for its share of costs, expenses and fees plus any costs, expenses and fees required under JAMS procedures.</li>
<li>Litigation. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms of Use. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under these Terms of Use, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal’s determination of the merits of the controversy).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Class-Action Waiver</h3>
<p>Any arbitration, claim or other proceedings by or between you and us shall be conducted on an individual basis and not as a class action or proceeding, mass action, or on a consolidated or representative basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief or to combine or aggregate similar claims or unrelated transactions. You acknowledge and agree that this agreement specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others. If, for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, each party waives any right to a jury trial. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.</p>
